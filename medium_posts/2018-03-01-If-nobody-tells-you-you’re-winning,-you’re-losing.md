subtitle: The most helpful sales advice I’ve ever received
---

I’ve been involved in hundreds of enterprise sales meetings and learned a ton from many talented sales professionals. The best piece of advice I ever received was from Larry D’Angelo. He told me that if nobody tells you you’re winning, you’re losing. What he meant was that when you’re in a sales cycle and going through the process — having meetings, doing demonstrations, answering written questions — and people are being polite, but nobody is explicitly coaching you, then someone else is in the lead. I’ve found this to be consistently true over the last fifteen years. Part is human nature — people like to share good news so if you’re not hearing good news, there probably isn’t any. Part is that even medium-sized organizations are complex and political. Different business buyers have different preferences and departments like legal, procurement and security are difficult to navigate. You can only really make it through all of that if you have at least one champion coaching you.

The reason Larry’s advice is so useful is because you can take action before it’s too late. **Ask your sales exec (or yourself) if someone is telling you you’re winning. If so, great. If not, dig in and ask the prospect hard questions. Try to find out where things really stand and see if you can develop a coach.** If you can’t then consider investing less in the sales cycle and make sure you’re still doing early stage prospecting for other opportunities with the same customer.

I saw Larry put his advice into practice during one of the early sales cycles at my first company. Idiom Technologies invented a “Globalization Management System” to help companies achieve rapid language translation. One of the first serious prospects was the FPGA chip manufacturer Xilinx. Xilinx had started publishing detailed marketing and technical information online to encourage engineers to design Xilinx chips into their products. Japan was a huge market for Xilinx, so they wanted to create and maintain Japanese translations of their content.

We were one of two companies developing workflow technology for web translation. Our direct competitor, GlobalSight, was based in Silicon Valley just a short drive from Xilinx’s San Jose headquarters. We were based in Cambridge and needed to fly across the country for meetings. The Xilinx business person was Miniko Pettersen who not only knew a ton about managing translation but was herself a former English to Japanese translator.

Miniko had genuine pain and was willing to accept the risk of putting a largely unproven solution in place. At the time, Idiom and GlobalSight were both new companies with few production references. We had many meetings and demos and to me it felt like we had a good shot. We were rising to the challenges Xilinx threw at us and proved we could handle Japanese — something that wasn’t trivial back then.

After one of our meetings, Larry pulled me aside and told me that GlobalSight must be in the lead since Miniko wasn’t telling us we were winning. I figured she was just keeping her cards close. But Larry was right. He asked Miniko some uncomfortable questions and she opened up. She did in fact prefer GlobalSight. She explained why, which gave us a chance to overcome her concerns. Through passion and technical excellence we eventually won her over. In fact, after a key demo and discussion she openly told us that she wanted to go with us. In other words, she told us we were winning. From there it was procurement, legal negotiation and then a signed purchase order. It’s been 18 years and I still feel enormous gratitude to Miniko for placing her faith in us.

It’s nice to see the PO come in especially after a long roller coaster sales cycle. Look at that — annual is spelled wrong! (This isn’t the Xilinx PO.)
