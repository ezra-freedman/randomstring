Last winter, the product and development teams at our last company had the idea for an athletic team-building event. The invitation was sent out for… Curling.

We set up carpools to meet at the [Broomstones Curling Club](http://www.broomstones.com/) in Wayland, MA at 1:45PM, for a three hour event.

As we arrived, two other groups were arriving as well: One was from Twitter, the other from a lab at MIT.

The facility is located up a winding lane in the woods, providing a nice contrast to Boston’s Seaport, where we would typically be working on a Thursday afternoon. It’s warm, with dark carpets, lots of natural wood, and a large fireplace.

The club is member-run, and members had graciously volunteered to share their knowledge and love of the sport with us. In groups of five, we learned the basics: how to throw stones, how to sweep, how to score and the various roles. Before long, we had multiple games going.

That’s me, foot against the hack, preparing to deliver a stone.

The event was awesome. Some things I loved about it:

  * **None of us had curled before.** We all had to learn something new, starting with rules and base principles.
  * **We were doing something athletic, unique, New Englandey and fun.**
  * **In a short period of time, we were competing.** While I assume we weren’t objectively good, it sure felt like we had skills.
  * **We collaborated with new people.** We were put on teams with people we might not work with day-to-day.

### Summary

In my recent post, [Coding Under the Influence](https://medium.com/random-string/coding-under-the-influence-8e117b2b804), I opined on the technology industry’s problematic focus on drinking. This event was a reminder that there are great options for team building that don’t require a drink.
