subtitle: Why you need visionary customers
---

You may have a vision, but just as important is finding customers with vision. Call them visionaries, early adopters, cowboys…these are the people who through some combination of personality, vision and need want to try something new and are willing to stick their necks out to make it happen.

Most potential customers triangulate based on what peers across the industry are doing, but visionaries are willing to leap without peer assurance. They build internal consensus to try something novel and figure out how to get a new vendor through legal and procurement.

The relationship between a startup and its early customers is special and I want to acknowledge the first three people to commit to TrialNetworks. First some background so you can appreciate the height from which they leaped.

TrialNetworks pioneered a collaboration platform for the site and sponsor staff working on a clinical trial. A **clinical trial** or **study** is a critical, complicated, regulated and expensive experiment to determine if a treatment is safe and effective. The trial **sponsor** is the pharmaceutical company or academic group leading the study. **Sites** are the individual hospitals and medical offices that enroll patients into the study and follow those patients over time. Putting this all together, a pharmaceutical company sponsors a clinical trial to determine if a new medicine is safe and effective. The trial involves 100 sites spread across ten countries. These sites collectively enroll and follow 1000 patients with an overall duration from “first patient in” to “last patient out” of three years.

With this background you can see why our ask of early customers was big. We were proposing to deploy an unproven technology as part of a critical and regulated project. And this wasn’t just some internal productivity tool. To be useful, all of the doctors, nurses, study coordinators, pharmacists and other site personnel would need access. That level of exposure isn’t something you take lightly when your company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars researching and developing a new medicine. Conservatism is more than reasonable when patient safety, data integrity and regulatory compliance are paramount.

### Steve

Steve Sweeney was the first person to commit to TrialNetworks. Steve spent the first decade of his career learning the ins and outs of trial operations at two organizations: Quintiles, the biggest and most prestigious contract research organization; and Pfizer, then the largest pharmaceutical company in the world. By the time we met Steve he was leading clinical operations at Infinity Pharmaceuticals. Steve is a forward thinker by nature, but his experience also gave him conviction that the status quo for sponsor and site collaboration was stuck in the pre-connected era. Steve saw the potential of our idea from our very first meeting; and just as clearly he saw it would be hard for his busy team to embrace anything new.

A visionary customer works things from both sides. Steve painted a picture to his team of how TrialNetworks would help them and encouraged us to build useful features. We needed project management artifacts from studies (e.g. memos and spreadsheets) for design input and Steve supplied those. Most helpful, Steve made himself available outside of business hours to review mockups and share detailed feedback on everything from permissions to search. We closed out Mr. Sushi in Brookline more than once after a marathon design session. Steve succeeded at shaping our product and at encouraging his team to adopt new ways of working with sites. In fact, a few of the people on Steve’s team who were reluctant adopters at first later became expert users and enthusiastic supporters.

### Jackie

An American today is 70% less likely to die from heart disease than other causes compared to half a century ago. Our understanding of heart disease has been growing for decades, leading to ever better prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Three groups have been at the forefront of this research: TIMI at Harvard, DCRI at Duke and PHRI at McMaster University. The physicians and researchers at these institutions influence medical practice around the world. We eventually worked with all three groups, but our first was PHRI.

[Population Health Research Institute](http://www.phri.ca/), led by Dr. Salim Yusuf, is based in Hamilton, Ontario. We cold-called one of Dr. Yusuf’s colleagues, Dr. Hertzel Gerstein, and he suggested we speak with Jackie Bosch, a “very senior project manager.” We later realized that Jackie’s project manager title was deceptive, as her breadth of responsibility and depth of experience went way beyond managing projects. We ran our concept by Jackie over the phone and listened to her feedback. We ended the call by thanking Jackie and letting her know that our next step was to find early adopters. We asked if we could circle back with PHRI as we progressed.

Our implication that Jackie and PHRI were not early adopters was unintentional reverse psychology. Jackie was the person at PHRI who often piloted new technology and was more interested in TrialNetworks than we realized. Jackie ended up championing our product and the [HOPE-3](http://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/clinical-trials/2016/03/25/16/27/hope-3) study became the second clinical trial to go live on TrialNetworks.

Large outcomes studies like HOPE-3 take years to complete. In 2016, nine years after enrolling its first patient and five years after we became involved, HOPE-3 reported results in [The New England Journal of Medicine](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1600176).

### Ed

We met Ed Campanaro at an executive breakfast seminar in Boston. At the time he was Vice President of Clinical Operations at Cubist Pharmaceuticals and in the process of launching two major studies. Ed had joined Cubist ten years earlier when it was much smaller and worked on studies that led to regulatory approval of Cubicin, Cubist’s first marketed product. Ed was widely respected at Cubist and had great relationships throughout the company.

Ed had two insights that gave him vision and conviction around TrialNetworks. Ed knew that sponsor-site relationships are important for study success. Back when he was running smaller trials, Ed made sure that he and his team were in frequent communication with sites. That was now impossible. The new trials had hundreds of sites and almost all day-to-day contact was outsourced to contract research organizations. Ed needed a way to keep sites engaged.

Ed’s second insight came from using social media. Ed was early among his peers at senior levels in clinical development to embrace social media. His personal experience convinced him that similar techniques could engender sponsor-site communication that was centralized, efficient and also personal. That may seem obvious now, but at the time standard practice was mailing or emailing newsletters and paying contract research organizations to make frequent phone calls to sites.

Ed Campanaro

Besides committing to using TrialNetworks on two important studies, Ed made many contributions to our evolution. For example, we were thinking about hiring a study coordinator. Study coordinators work at sites and manage study execution including communicating with patients, working with doctors, handling paperwork and recording data. Our own in-house study coordinator could shape TrialNetworks features and help our customers use those features to communicate with sites. We wanted to find someone credible. Ed helped interview and with his endorsement we hired [Natalya Gud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalyagud). Natalya became an essential member of our team and hiring tech-savvy study coordinators became an ingredient of our special sauce.

Our leaderboard feature was another of Ed’s contributions. Sites are busy with multiple clinical trials and regular patient care, which means a sponsor needs to work to keep its trial top of mind. Ed encouraged us to create a site-facing leaderboard feature that would automatically update and show metrics such as number of patients enrolled and number of unresolved data queries. The idea was to convey momentum and encourage friendly competition among sites. We were concerned the idea might not be “serious” enough for our platform, but in a great example of a visionary customer being more visionary than the startup, Ed committed to using the feature for his studies. The idea was well received and became widely used.

Thank you Steve, Jackie and Ed for having vision, sticking your necks out, and placing your faith in us.

(This blog post wouldn’t be complete without also giving credit to our VP Business Development and essentially co-founder [Cameron Snider](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameronsnider/). Yes, these customers were visionary, but they were also busy. Cameron employed polite persistence to keep TrialNetworks on the priority list.)
