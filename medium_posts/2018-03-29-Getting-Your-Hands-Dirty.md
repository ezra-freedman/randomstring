This post is about getting your hands dirty. It might also be about leadership or failing to value your time.

My son Andy knocked over his cereal bowl this morning. His milk and Cheerios (actually Joe's O's) spilled all over the place. After Andy's half-hearted attempt to clean the mess, I got down on my hands and knees and shoveled the soggy cereal back into the bowl while my kids made disgusted sounds. It brought back a memory from nearly fifteen years ago.

In 2004, my wife and I bought and turned around a failing pizza restaurant. Buying a business is like buying a house in that you discover things along the way. One Saturday, I went in and our three-basin sink (wash, rinse, sanitize) was barely draining. I traced the drain pipe to a big steel box that looked like this.

I’d noticed the box before but never gave it much thought. After our lunch rush, I loosened the top and my nose was met with this horrible, putrid odor that’s now permanently etched in my brain. The box was filled with water, grease, food and hair.

I put on rubber cleaning gloves, reached in, and could feel that the grease and solids were blocking the water from going over, under or through vertical steel plates. I asked one of our guys to wheel over the trash can and I started scooping out the grease and water. It was impossible to stay clean. The grease and water poured in through the edges of my gloves and splashed my shirt and jeans. Our manger offered to help but the job was so disgusting and smelly it was beyond what I could ask him or anyone else to do, plus I was already dirty. So our team watched while I scooped and passed the point of even trying to stay clean.

It took hours to remove all of the floating grease and food, scrape the congealed grease off of the inside walls and vertical plates, and figure out how to get the thing back together. I fastened the top and checked that our sink drained. I threw the garbage bag in the dumpster, cleaned and sanitized the outside of the metal box, mopped the floor and washed my hands.

I didn’t want to get my car all greasy so I walked home. I threw out my clothes and took a shower. The odor was so pungent that even after days I couldn’t get it off my skin. It could have just been psychological except that my wife independently verified the smell. If you get sprayed by a skunk you’re supposed to take a bath in tomato sauce, but I only gave that brief consideration. (Even at bulk restaurant prices it would get pretty expensive to fill a tub with tomato sauce. Maybe you’re supposed to do more of a sponge bath.)

It turns out the metal box was a grease trap and you hire a company to perform regular maintenance. The company pumps out the grease and disposes of it properly. You're definitely not supposed to bag the grease and throw it in the dumpster. Don't tell Mcgeoghan Waste Systems.
