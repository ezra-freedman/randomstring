A job search on Indeed for “Beer Software” in Boston returns 40 results. None of the results are for breweries, distributors, or other companies that might require knowledge of beer software. What gives?

Alcohol has become a big part of technology company culture. Here are some snippets from the job descriptions returned by my search:

  * “Friday beer cart”
  * “Variety of local beers on tap”
  * “Wine, beer, spirits, and snacks always on hand”
  * “Fridge stocked with craft beer”
  * “Beer Fridays, unlimited snacks, cold brew coffee — physiological needs, check”
  * “Plus, there’s the usual good stuff like Commuter & Gym reimbursements, Apple hardware, free snacks, lunches, and beer”
  * “Stocked beer fridge (nice beer, not just Bud Light)”
  * “Unlimited coffee, tea, and beer”
  * “Cold brew tap, beer and cider fridge, and snacks to help fuel your day”
  * “Founder most focused on day 1 technical competency (can code well with Python!) AND a good person — someone he could grab a beer with ”

### Reading these job descriptions, what should we conclude?

  * beer is a “physiological need”
  * to be a “good person,” you need to drink beer
  * having access to an “unlimited” amount of beer at work is a perk
  * Bud Light is lame (_well I guess I agree with this one_)

### Reading these job descriptions, what questions should we ask ourselves?

  * **Does the emphasis on drinking make non-drinking co-workers feel left out?** According to the [2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUH-DetTabs-2015/NSDUH-DetTabs-2015/NSDUH-DetTabs-2015.pdf), 70.1 percent of people age 18 or older reported that they drank in the past year. While it might not always seem that way, there are a lot of non-drinkers!
  * **Does the emphasis on drinking encourage employees to drink more, or make it easy for recovering alcoholics to relapse?** According to a [study on alcoholism published in JAMA Psychiatry in 2017](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2647079?redirect=true), ~12% of American adults are alcoholic, and this is a number that’s increasing.
  * **Does drinking culture perpetuate or exacerbate workplace harassment?** At least one study, “[Harassing under the influence: the prevalence of male heavy drinking, the embeddedness of permissive workplace drinking norms, and the gender harassment of female coworkers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17638490)”, shows a **“significant association” between permissiveness of workplace drinking norms and gender harassment toward female coworkers**. In an industry that is actively trying to find its way with regards to gender equality in pay, opportunity and representation, why take this risk?
  * **Would you want the people writing software for your pacemaker to be coding under the influence**? Airplane autopilot systems? Your self-driving car? Software is already part of many critical, life-or-death systems, and this will only be the case more and more in the coming years.

### How did we get here?

  * Part of what has happened I would describe as “Keeping up with the Joneses.” There is a lot of competition for hiring, so companies don’t want their office to lack something that some people might find a perk.
  * Startups are supposed to be disruptive, and to value independent thinkers. A kegerator on site might be seen as “anti-corporate.” _(Though from anecdotal evidence it seems that corporate America is playing “catch up” and jumping on the beer bandwagon too)._

### But I like beer

Don’t get me wrong, I like beer, and there are some clear benefits to sharing a drink with your colleagues, including in the workplace.

  * It can be a great way to connect: “You like Lawson’s Sip of Sunshine? Me too!”
  * It can be a great way to unwind after a particularly challenging week, maybe after a big win (or a big defeat).

## Summary

While there is an argument to be made for a completely dry workplace, I would not go that far. I am advocating, however, for us to do the following**:**

  1. Make alcohol in the workplace special, not every day
  2. Always offer non-alcoholic options when providing alcohol _(a quick Google brings up companies trying to fill this need, including_[ _Curious Elixirs_](http://curiouselixirs.com/) _,_[_The Mocktail Company_](http://www.themocktailcompany.com/) _and others)_
  3. Don’t position alcohol in as a benefit as you would things like health insurance, vacation, etc. If someone only wants to work for you because you provide unlimited booze, it’s probably not the best fit.
