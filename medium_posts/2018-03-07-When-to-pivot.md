subtitle: Why we decided to change strategy nine months into our startup
---

Choosing when to stay the course and when to pivot is a sleep reducing strategic decision. Everyone knows that you don’t get anywhere unless you stay the course, persist through the pain, overcome naysayers and prove your mettle. Everyone also knows that you don’t get anywhere by banging your head against a concrete wall. There is no right answer but here’s our story.

We started Epernicus to accelerate research by building LinkedIn for scientists. Scientists could find experts, resources and networking opportunities through our specialized social networking platform. Our beta design group consisted of members of the Langer Lab at MIT and clinician researchers at Harvard Medical School. We developed science-centric features. For example, an Epernicus profile highlighted a scientist’s academic genealogy, publications and skills. We also developed standard social network capabilities like searching, connecting and messaging.

An Epernicus profile from 2008

We started to think about a pivot six months in when we weren’t seeing the type of viral growth or sustained frequent use that would signal we were doing something of value. We were meeting with our early users all the time — having coffee with people around MIT and holding small user group discussions. We heard many great ideas. Grad students, postdocs and fellows told us they liked our service, they really liked how their profiles looked and some people even said they were searching Epernicus several times per week. All that sounded good, but the stats didn’t back it up. We tracked every single interaction and saw no evidence of frequent users, a killer application or organic viral growth. The question was could we get there and if so in how much time and with what type of funding.

From the start, our founding team agreed that our strategy would be guided by getting to profitability quickly. If we were going to raise significant capital, it would only be after we were standing on solid ground. It’s one thing to experience true organic growth and use outside capital to support and accelerate it. It’s another to use outside capital to force user growth with the idea that the chicken and egg problem will solve itself at scale. Both strategies can work but the second is much riskier. We needed to first prove to ourselves that we were doing something of value.

Our premise was that researchers didn’t have a good way to search the wealth of expertise, potential collaborators, capabilities and ideas at even their own institutions not to mention across the world. If the situation could be improved then research would accelerate. The problem was that for many scientists this wasn’t an acute, frequent or perceived need. In a tight knit and competitive community, people have a good sense of who is doing what and are wary of sharing information prematurely.

It’s instructive to compare business professionals with academic researchers in terms of the impact of an online profile. Prior to LinkedIn, the professional lives of the majority of company employees were invisible outside of their companies. Creating a public resume on LinkedIn was novel and provided much greater personal exposure than was conventionally possible or acceptable. This was not the situation for academic scientists. For hundreds of years researchers have published their work to scholarly journals. Researchers receive public credit because they are listed as authors on publications. This applies not just to principal investigators but to everyone involved in research. A scientist’s publication record **is** their most important profile. An online profile like Epernicus that brings everything together was useful, but it wasn’t game changing like LinkedIn.

### Our Pivot

After another three months we weighed what was going well with our concerns and made our first substantial pivot. Instead of a public and free social network for academic researchers, we became a private service for research-centric companies and adopted a software-as-a-service business model. This B2C to B2B shift brought us to profitability and gave us a whole new set of learnings. We later decided to put all of our focus on a specific type of research, clinical trials, and rebranded from Epernicus to TrialNetworks.

Even looking back after nine years we don’t know if our decision to pivot was optimal. We had a bunch of optimistic signals that, if nurtured, might have turned our open network into something of importance to the scientific community. On the other hand, we lowered our risk by pivoting from our original concept but sticking to our plan of getting to profitability early.

### Similar Companies

A few other companies started with similar ideas around the same time.

[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/) stuck to building a science social network and supported that mission by raising large amounts of capital. I’d really like to know how they’re doing as a business and how important they are to their users. What would happen if someone turned off the service?

[JoVE](https://www.jove.com/) started as a video platform to share biological research. They quickly realized that researchers are far more interested in publishing to peer reviewed journals than sharing just for the sake of sharing. JoVE adjusted their service to be a peer-reviewed video journal and adopted the journal business model. My sense is it was a very smart pivot and they now have a strong business and are playing a meaningful role in science.

[Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/), now part of Elsevier, shared our goal of improving scientific collaboration but started with a focused workflow task — helping scientists store, organize, annotate, cite, search and share articles. It was and is a real need. One good thing about their strategy is their product was useful to individual researchers even without network effects. That let Mendeley grow first as a tool and later work on social features.

We’re glad we pivoted. The TrialNetworks software has become an important part of many clinical trials and the impact will keep increasing now that it’s part of IQVIA. Speaking of clinical trials, if we could have spun up parallel universes we would have done a randomized controlled trial to compare pivoting with staying the course. Unfortunately that technology wasn’t available at the time or now…maybe it will come with quantum computing.
